    if the grade is 38 ot more

        grade and next multiple is less than 3

    otherwise leave grade as it is.

Drawing Book: 
    front: p//2 (Math.floor(p/2))
    back: n//2 - p//2 (Math.floor(n/2)-Math.floor(p/2))
    apply min function
        min(front,back)
    
Divisible Sum Pairs
    take 2 loops
    calculate the sum  and check is Divisible by k value
    yes then increase the Pairs count
    lastly return the pair count
    (TRY TO MAKE IT OPTIMIZED CODE ALSO)
        USE REMINDER AND COMPLEMENT
        calculate Pairs

Min Max Sum
    find out the sum or all possible values and then 
    print min and Max

    find out total sum
    find out min num
    find out max num
    to check minSum = total -max
    to get maxSum = total - min

    complexity become n (no loop)

    2. Camel Case Solution:

        using regex:
            function camelcase(s) {
                const regex= /[A-Z]/g
                const count = s.match(regex)
                return count.length+1;
        }
