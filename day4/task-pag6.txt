problem1: Maximum Perimeter Triangle

    sort sticks into descending order
    check triples (a,b,c)
        a<b+c 

problem 2: Alternatic Characters
--- iterate through string, count Characters matches with previos 
return the no of delete

problem 3: check its pangram
    convert entire string into lower Case 
    then compare with all a-z letters and if the length is 26 then
    print its pangram else not

    in python use: set('a-z')
    ins JS use: regex

Problem 4: Beautiful Binary String

    iterate the string till its length-2
    everytime you can check the pattern with "010"
    if match then increase the coount by 1
    and increase i by 3

    if not match then increase i by 1

problem 5: Utopian Tree
    iterate the loop start height=1 at level 0
    loop start from 1
    logic for double and increment by 1

problem 6: beautiful triplets
    remove duplicates using set
    then start from first element increase value by 3 if that number
    present in array then agian increase by 3 and take it as pair count

problem 7: Picking Numbers
    longest subarray where the diffrence is <=1

    declare arrayMaxLen=0
    iterate loop create subarray as per the condition and then compare maxlen
    lastly return max length

problem 8: Repeated String
    find Repeated String base on string and s and n

    n=10 s="aba"
    full=Math.floor(n/s.length)  = (10/3) = 3
    rem= n % s.length = 10%3 = 1
    s.count('a').length * full + s.substring(0).length
    2*3+1 = 7

problem 9: Hackerrank is a String   
        take one target="hackerrank"
        start iterating your string  and if its matches with the target string
        letter then increase by 1
        if match then print YES

problem 10: PDF Viewer
    based on the given height array 
    find out height for all word letter and get the max height
    then return maxheight * word_length
